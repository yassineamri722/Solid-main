# ðŸ§© SOLID Principles - Lab 3

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains the implementation and refactoring exercises for **Lab 3: The SOLID Principles** in the *Software Reengineering* course (Professor Amina Jarraya, 2024).

The goal of this lab is to understand and apply each of the five SOLID principles through practical examples:
1. **SRP** â€“ Single Responsibility Principle  
2. **OCP** â€“ Open/Closed Principle  
3. **LSP** â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle  
4. **ISP** â€“ Interface Segregation Principle  
5. **DIP** â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle  

Each folder contains:
- The **original example** (before refactoring)
- The **refactored example** (after applying the principle)
- An **exercise** applying the same principle
- UML diagrams (created with PlantUML)
- Short explanations in the report
